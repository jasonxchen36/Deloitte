**Content Team General Task**

**What:** Content Team General Tasks (CTGT) allow us to track a whole variety of things--dashboards, documentations, future items-- essentially anything that needs to be done by the content team that is not an alert. The WI allows us to keep it on our agenda and also to link it to relevant activities that may directly relate or involve.

The states for CTGT items are the following:
- New
  - Recently created, not started & possibly unassigned
- On Hold
  - No clear path-forward, or no longer a team necessity
- Active
  - Work in progress by a Content team member
- Awaiting Stakeholder
  - Requires stakeholder input to proceed
- Closed
  - Task has been completed

CTGT items that are reported to Project S PMO should have the "PMO" tag and a blurb in the "Report Status_PMO Tag" field describing specific progress.

The CTGT boards can be viewed by navigating to the Build Content Team's boards and selecting "Project" in the top right.

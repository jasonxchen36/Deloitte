**Content Feedback Items**

**What: The Content Feedback Item allows the Monitoring and Content Teams to accurately track filtering and logic change requests before each item is pushed out to production. This item will be linked the corresponding Build Content Item and the discussion portion of this item is where we will track and communicate with the Monitoring Team**

**In the "Feedback Work Item Type" section, set the "Enabled in Production?" boolean as true if the item is for production content, and false if not. Set the "Build Team Item?" boolean as true if the build content team is responsible for responding to the feedback, or leave as false if it is a run content task**

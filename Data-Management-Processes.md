This section contains the processes relevant to the Data Management Team (data on-boarding, CIM Validation, etc.)

Please keep in mind that only approved data sources should be onboarded. Onboarding work is tracked via ServiceNow tickets and DevOps work items. 

Also, only production data is onboarded to Splunk. Dev data can be onboarded to Dev Splunk for testing but only prod data should go to prod Splunk.

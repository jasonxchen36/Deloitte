This wiki page describes how to purchase reserved VM instances in Azure environment.

Procurement for the Cloud Environments is set to be run twice-annually.  Once in January and once in July.
Reviews of the environments should be conducted at least one month in advance to determine any net-new infrastructure that might be required to support ingest.

The DTTL ECMS Azure: [DTCMSAzure@deloitte.com](mailto:DTCMSAzure@deloitte.com "mailto:dtcmsazure@deloitte.com") team works on cloud cost efficiencies, and should be consulted to assist in reviewing current infrastructure to help determine if resizing of specific instances should be performed ahead of reservation.

To perform the reservations, either work with the DTTL ECMS Azure team, or perform the following steps:

Â 
1. Navigate to the Virtual Machine page and click on Purchase from the Reservations drop menu.

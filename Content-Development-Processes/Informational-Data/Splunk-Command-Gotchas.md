|**sort**  | If no count is specified, (ie  ' I **sort** _dest_ ') the default limit of 10000 result is used. If 0 is specified, all results are returned. Solution: use **sort - 0** instead of simply **sort**. Or your results to be trucated at 10k |  [Docs](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.3.0/SearchReference/Sort) | 
| **inputlookup** | When using **inputlookup** in a _subsearch_ there is a 60 second & a 10,000 result limit.  If the _subsearch_ takes 61 seconds (it will stop the subsearch and process the rest of the SPL) or returns 10,001 results (it will have 1 missing result) it will give up. Alternatives: Use append without _subsearch_ OR use the **lookup** (reads events) command instead of the **inputlookup** (creates new events). Alternatively, specify stats values(<field>) as <field> and run a search on that field to bypass the 10,000 sub-search result limit. | [[Docs](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.3.0/SearchReference/Inputlookup)] [[Splunk Answers](https://answers.splunk.com/answers/390349/what-is-the-basic-difference-between-the-lookup-in.html)] |
| **join** | When joining two tables, Splunk will not evaluate a wildcard as a metacharacter while matching on a join, but rather take it as a literal string “\*”. For example, an entry in table A “ABC*” will not be considered a match with an entry in the same field in table B “ABCDEF” in a join of table A and table B. The only match it will find is with the exact same string “ABC*” in table B. <br/><br/>Solution: Use a regular expression to extract the portion of the field value that needs to be matched on (i.e. extract the domain of a url and match exactly on domains).  |  |
| **lookup** | Note that when using lookup tables in which you are trying to match on number/integer values, there can be a type mismatching error that leads to the subsearch returning a match whether there is indeed a match or not. <br/><br/> Solution: Play around with converting search values to strings. In my case, converting my tstats port number values to strings before filtering them out with a lookup solved the issue. Here is the line I used:<br/><center> \| eval field_name tostring(field_name)|  |
|**_time**  |When you use the _time field in the your tstats command, you CANT use _time alone; an earliest or latest argument must be used in conjunction with _time e.g latest(_time)
 Fields | At the end of your splunk Query please include a fields command with all the fields you wish to table, and also please make sure that fields are one word or joined with an underscore rather than a space and quotations. We run an automation script to create our stanzas and it does not like quotatin marks as it creates a double quotation error in the eval field that the script creates for SNOW. For example: "Bad Field" vs. Good_Field|
| Fields vs Table | As a General best practice, it is better to use fields as this command is streaming and distributable across the cluster, whereas table is not. This includes subsearches, join commands and append commands. When do you use a table command? A table command can be used at the end of a search but please look at the row above this one. a table command can be used for specific ordering or as the sole tabular command similar to stats.   
| Lookup | If it possible to use a lookup command instead of an inputlookup, please use lookup.  A lookup command is much more efficent, and inputlookup will revert to the search heads
| Lookup vs Inputlookup vs Join | do not try to inputlookup or join on more than 50k rows as it caps out there and we will miss results. Use a lookup command where possible.
| Do Not use a Severity Field in splunk | If you use a severity field in splunk it will override the SNOWARA field and cause notables not to generate tickets. An alternative would be alert_severity, serverity_SPL, etc.| |  |

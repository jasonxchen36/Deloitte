If looking for Deloitte servers or other network assets e.g. to create a lookup for a correlation search, try glb.deloitteresources.com. 

From there go to "services" and you can search through services by app number. Below is a running list of known app numbers:

app0196: DNS/Wins
app0001: Domain Controllers (all of which run DNS services)

Note the "Assets" tab with the assets in that service.

Hi <Knowledge Holder>,

My name is < Insert Name>, I work with the Fusion Center Engineering Team developing Global Event Monitoring in Splunk.
To drive detection of <RFED Purpose (Alert needing referential data)> <Short Description or the alert> in Splunk and reduce false positive detection. We are requesting < Request for Environmental Data Work Item Title>. <Brief Description of what you would like to see/Complementary details>. If this data changes periodically, can you please share how often? Is there a recommended programmatic approach to consume this data and keep it up to date?

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns, thank you in advance for your help.

Thanks,

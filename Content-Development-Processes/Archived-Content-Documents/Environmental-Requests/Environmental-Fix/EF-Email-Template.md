Hi <Knowledge Holder>,

My name is < Insert Name>, I work with the Fusion Center Engineering Team developing Global Event Monitoring in Splunk.
To drive detection of <RFED Purpose (Alert needing referential data)>, This alert detects <Short Description of the alert> in Splunk and reduce false positive detection. We are requesting < Request for Environmental Data Work Item Title>. <Brief Description of what is going on in our environment currently>. Additionally, if this configuration changes on a periodic basis, we would like to know how often this change occurs, if it does change, and how we can ensure that we receive future updates in a timely fashion.

Please let me know if we can be of any help regarding this issue, and would be more than willing to hop on call to explain further if needed.

Thanks,
<Requestor>

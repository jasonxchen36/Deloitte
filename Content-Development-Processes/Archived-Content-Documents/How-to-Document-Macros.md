It is very important to document all the macros (except `summariesonly`)

1. If this macro already has a pre-existing "Macro Work Item Type" then tag it under related links. If this item does not have any existing macro lookup item, then you must create that item. Please refer to the documentation for macros.
2. Once you link the macro in related links, you must then document the macro in the Macro Documentation Page, please follow the format of the table.
3. Once this is all done, then you can switch the Macros Linked Boolean.

To prevent confusion and merge conflicts, the Build Content Team puts all its content updates (to Volume Testing and Production) into one PR each change window. Each morning after a change window, a new branch entitled Content_Updates_MMDDYY is created. The first person to push changes to this branch will create a Pull Request. 

New changes should not be submitted up to 4 hours before the SHC change review call (outside of updates / fixes to previously added changes). This provides a review cushion and prevents situations where all changes are ready for production except the last minute ones, which prevent the branch from being merged.

The description of this Pull Request will keep a changelog of all the changes made so there is no confusion for edits made to Volume Testing content vs. Production.

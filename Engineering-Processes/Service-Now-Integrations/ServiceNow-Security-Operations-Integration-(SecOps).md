
The scope of this integration is to pull the notable events from Splunk into ServiceNow instead of Splunk sending them directly. This way ServiceNow can redirect the tickets to specific queues/teams and do additional parsing on the alert format or data.

The app need to download from Splunk Base, [ServiceNow Security Operations Addon | Splunkbase](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3921)

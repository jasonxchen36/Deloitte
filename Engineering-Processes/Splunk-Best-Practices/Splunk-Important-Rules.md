### The following rules will be strictly implemented going forward.

1.	Do not ssh to our production servers outside our change window unless you have an exemption of P1/troubleshooting. We have enforced security monitoring on all your logins so please be ready to answer when questioned for the purpose of your login. If you identify that Splunk is down on any of our PROD SHâ€™s or anything that has been impacting the current Splunk performance, always raise a P1 ticket first and then continue troubleshooting.
2.	Issues impacting the entire environment, always make sure to notify the leads about it so that we can track the progress.
3.	Please be VERY VERY VERY mindful when you are on the PROD servers and do not run rm/delete commands unless you have a valid reason.
4. Do not switch to root account unless absolutely required. 


## Your SSH access will be revoked immediately for any unreasonable behavior.

Note: For US & AMER environments only

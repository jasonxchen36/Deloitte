Currently we are managing our Splunk servers admin account passwords from Splunk, so please note that for SHC we are unable to maintain a unique password for each member in the cluster as the passwd file gets replicated across all members.
Therefore we will be managing password for only one member of the cluster form Thycotic and rest of the SHâ€™s will pick up from it.

Please find the below server list which are active and rotates password for respective environment SHC.

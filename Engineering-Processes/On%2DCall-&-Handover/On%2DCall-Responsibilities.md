# Engineers Standard Operating Procedures During or Before On-Call – US/USI Support

* * *

Overview
--------

All designated members of the Architecture, Content Development, and Health Monitoring teams are required to participate in the on-call rotation. Each participant is responsible for providing on-call coverage for their assigned shifts as per the published schedule. **Shifts may not be swapped** without prior written notification 
to:
*   Robert Smith (US)
    
*   Uddaraju Srisahitya Varma (USI)
    
*   Juan Mallorquín (Spain)
    
The on-call schedule is published quarterly, at least **30 days in advance**, and incorporates all approved training and PTO as updated in Humanity. Engineers must review the schedule and notify the appropriate contacts of any conflicts requiring changes at least **10 business days prior** to the schedule’s start/effective date.
Each engineer must be available for their entire shift. While on-call, the participant must be prepared to work at all times and respond to calls within **15 minutes**. You must be able to log in to your Deloitte-issued laptop within **30 minutes** of being contacted and have reliable internet access with adequate power backup.  
**Under no circumstances may an employee on call refuse to respond.** Failure to respond within the required timeframe may result in disciplinary action.

Mandatory On-Call Tasks
-----------------------

When responding to an on-call incident, perform the following tasks:
*   **Verify** that all Splunk instances are up and running in all regions: US, AMER, EMEA, and APAC.
    
*   **Acknowledge** the incident by adding the label `Engineering_oncall` to the incident.
    
*   **Respond** via agreed communication channels (e.g., telephone, system alert) within 15 minutes, and be available to address issues (typically within one hour at most).
    
*   **Keep on-call records and ServiceNow/Work Item tickets updated** with all relevant evidence or actions.
    *   Immediately inform the respective service lead if the issue is severe, urgent, has high operational impact, or affects a large user group.
        
*   **Communicate** the resolution or workaround to the SOC and any other contacts previously informed of the incident once the incident is resolved or a workaround is applied.
    
*   **If no resolution or workaround is found during the shift**, send a handover email with the details of the situation and ticket number to the engineering team.
    

> **Note 1:**  
> If the primary on-call does not have adequate access in the client environment, update the ticket and contact the backup engineer. If the backup engineer also lacks access, the primary engineer must notify the SOC to reach out to the assigned client lead or client engineer.

> **Note 2:**  
> If a participant is unable to fulfill their on-call duties due to illness or emergency PTO, Content Leads Robert Smith (US) and Uddaraju Srisahitya Varma (USI) will designate a replacement until the scheduled engineer is able to resume duty.

Scheduling and Changes
----------------------

The engineering on-call schedule uses a **follow-the-sun** model, enabling issues to be handled by and passed between time zones for greater responsiveness and reduced delays.

### Weekday On-Call Rotation Requirements

*   Weekly shifts begin on **Monday** and end on **Friday** in local time zones.
    
*   **USI MTS team:** 8:00 pm – 4:00 am Eastern Time  
    (Starts Sunday, ends Thursday due to time zone differences)
    
*   **Spain MTS team:** 4:00 am – 11:30 am Eastern Time
    
*   **US MTS team:** 11:30 am – 8:00 pm Eastern Time
    

### Weekend On-Call Rotation Requirements

*   **USI MTS team:** Friday 8:00 pm – Sunday 8:00 pm Eastern Time
    

> **Note:**  
> Shift times will not be adjusted for daylight savings time.

Every effort will be made to ensure that the same individual does not work on the same major holidays recognized by the firm.
If an employee leaves the firm, their position in the rotation will be filled by a volunteer or a new employee assigned to cover the shift. If there is no volunteer, the times will be reassigned among the rotation team, or a new rotating schedule will be issued.

New employees deemed ready by Robert Smith (US) or Uddaraju Srisahitya Varma (USI) may be assigned to cover vacancies or may volunteer (with approval) for relief coverage. New employees will officially enter the rotation the first time a new schedule is issued after they have been deemed ready.

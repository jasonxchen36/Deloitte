1. Team Member must submit PTO to Team Lead within their home Country for approval at least 2 months prior to planned PTO date (unless there is an emergency, sick, or leave situation)

2. Team Lead confirms that no more than 40% of team is already taking PTO for the same dates. If over 40% of the team is already out, the Team Lead will request the Team Member to select different dates or discuss if an exception if required. 

3. Team Member sends out a PTO calendar meeting invite for the approved dates and marks it as "Free" to make the entire Engineering Team aware. Team Member also creates a personal appointment in their calendar and marks this as "Out of Office" to ensure only their calendar is blocked for the PTO timeframe.  

4. As PTO date is approaching, Team Member consults with Team Lead to ensure PTO coverage is established and works to transition any work to other Engineering team members. 

5. Team Member declines, updates, cancels, or adds additional hosts to any meetings during their PTO timeframe. 

6. On the day prior to their PTO, the Team Member sets up their "Automatic Replies (Out of Office)" message for their PTO timeframe, including who to reach out to in their absence as well as the date of their return. 

_August Holiday Note:_
This process applies to the Spain August Holiday period as well. The Spain Team Members will be required to space out their PTO in the month of August to ensure that no more than 40% of the team is out each week. For example, half the team will take the first two weeks off and the other half take the second 2 weeks.

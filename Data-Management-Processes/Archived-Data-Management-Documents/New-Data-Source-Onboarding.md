#Onboarding steps for new data source:

##- Dev Environment: 
  - Create an index in the master index app on the Indexer Cluster Master (ICM)
    - Index Naming Convention: region/mf\_category\_vendor\_product

  - Push the new index out before going live with any data ingestion
  - Verify that data is extracted properly by Splunk
  - Verify that timestamps are accurate
  - Determine daily ingestion size
 - Review if log has user full name. If so, take a screenshot and send to your respective lead (Daisy Gallegos, Ryan Wick, or Daniel Azrak) for direction on whether masking is required. 
  - CIM normalization against the appropriate data models (refer to checklist on CIM validation work item in Devops for CIM normalization steps)
    - Add index name to macros.conf in Splunk CIM app (dev and production)
  - Create Feed Integration Plan (FIP) â€“ documentation for configuration of data source ingestion
    - [FIPS Directory](https://americas.internal.deloitteonline.com/sites/ctoteams/EnterpriseOperations/PlatformDelivery/splunk/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fsites%2Fctoteams%2FEnterpriseOperations%2FPlatformDelivery%2Fsplunk%2FShared%20Documents%2F40%2DDevice%20feed%20integration&amp;FolderCTID=0x012000AECBCD2BC82623459329C6A3B4413DD7&amp;View=%7BF040D9DD%2D9649%2D4613%2D8BD9%2D17345525F2C1%7D)
  - Update Splunk [Data Flow PowerPoint](https://americas.internal.deloitteonline.com/sites/ctoteams/EnterpriseOperations/PlatformDelivery/splunk/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=%2Fsites%2Fctoteams%2FEnterpriseOperations%2FPlatformDelivery%2Fsplunk%2FShared%20Documents%2F20-Design%20Splunk%20Environment%2FSplunk%20Data%20Flow%20Options%20-%20Global.pptx&amp;action=default)
  - Create Distributed Monitoring Console (DMC) health monitoring alert
    - Create by index if only one sourcetype exists in index, else if multiple sourcetypes exist, create by sourcetype
    - Test DMC alert by bringing the feed down
        - Take screenshot of alert that fired when feed goes down and paste screenshot on the respective onboarding work item
    - Document the health monitoring alert name on the data onboarding work item that will catch if this feed goes down
- Document Index details on Index_Mapping.csv through lookup editor
  - See New Index Documentation page for more information
##- Production Environment:
  - Create index in the master index app on the Indexer Cluster Master (ICM)
Index Naming Convention: region/mf\_category\_vendor\_product
  - Push the new index out before going live with any data ingestion
  - Verify that data is extracted properly by Splunk
  - Verify that timestamps are accurate
  - Verify CIM normalization (refer to checklist on CIM validation work item in Devops for CIM normalization steps)
    - Verify CIM normalization with Deloitte Global FC Engineering Content Run Team

      
This is the very first phase of data onboarding. Here we understand about the data sources, the application, type of logs, appliances and all other information related to the logs to help us proceed with the onboarding activity.

- **Step 1 –** The data owners/requestor creates a SNOW ticket to request us to onboard the logs from source/appliances/Infrastructure/applications into Splunk.
- **Step 2 –** The SNOW ticket is then reviewed and validated by the process team in collaboration with Data Management team leads.
- **Step 3 –** In case, there is some missing information or additional information requester is reached out by the process team/Data Management team and the snow ticket is updated accordingly.
- **Step 4 –** Once all the relevant and required information is received from the requester this ticket is approved by GEMS leadership to start the data onboarding efforts.
- **Step 5 –** If the ticket does not suffice with the relevant information or there is any challenges with onboarding efforts due to any reasons the ticket is rejected/cancelled by GEMS Leadership.

**Step 24 –** Once the data is into production, update the parameter “**Documentation**” in the data onboarding WI as **Yes** in the Data Onboarding WI and then close it. Please use the existing template to complete this phase and a new template is been worked on as the new template will remove some of the repetitive work. Update the document in this link on [teams](mailto:https://amedeloitte.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/CyberDefenseEngineering/Shared%20Documents/Data%20Management/Process%20Documentation/Data%20Feed%20Integration%20Plan?csf=1&web=1&e=xzXt7V)

**Sending Notification

This is one of the Key communication aspects to the stakeholders/GEMS and relevant teams. Once the data is in production and respective contents are running for the data, a notification is sent out to all the stakeholders on the availability of the data. update the parameter “**Notification Sent**” in the data onboarding WI as **Yes** in the Data Onboarding WI and the notification snapshot is added in the WI before closure of the Project/Data Onboarding WI.

**Step 25 –** We track our project/Data Onboarding efforts through DevOps, once the project/Data Onboarding WI is complete, we must close the Project and the respective DevOps WI linked with the project.

**Step 26 –** It is also important that once the project is closed, we close the RITM ticket with all possible information updated into it.

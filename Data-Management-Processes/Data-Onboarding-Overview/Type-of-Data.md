      
There are various types of logs that we have been onboarding into Splunk from different sources like applications, cloud platforms, infrastructures and accordingly from the reference of Splunk security framework these logs are mapped under various data models. The type of data onboarded could be broadly classified as:
- Application Security Data
- Cloud Security Data
- Infrastructure Security Data

**Application Security Data**

Application security data are logs which we onboard into Splunk from different applications of Deloitte present in on-prem or in the cloud platforms from various member firms and spanning across all the regions.
There are typically 4 kind of data sources we onboard into Splunk as a part of Application Security Data. These data are classified into various data models of Splunk are they are:
- Authentication Data
- Change Data
- Interprocess Messaging Data
- Web Data

**Cloud Security Data**

Cloud security data is the logs that are generated typically by the cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM cloud and many more. These platform logs have their own logging standards called the guardrails which provides us with the insights of what kind of logging is present, how to enable them and what are the logs we can expect of various services offered by the cloud platforms. We read through the document and map these logs as per our Splunk data models. There are various kind of data sources that we onboard for cloud security, and they are:
- Alerts 
- Assets and Identities
- Authentication           
- Certificates   
- Change
- DNS
- Data Loss Protection
- Proxy
- Email  
- Endpoint         
- Intrusion Detection
- Infrastructure Support          
- Malware          
- Network session        
- Network Traffic
- Threat Intelligence    
- Updates          
- Vulnerabilities

**Infrastructure Security Data**

Infrastructure security data is the logs that are generated by the infrastructure platforms that are present in Deloitte like venafi, cisco and other infrastructure platforms.
There are various kind of data sources that we onboard for infrastructure security, and they are:
- Alerts 
- Assets and Identities
- Authentication           
- Certificates   
- Change
- DNS
- Data Loss Protection
- Proxy
- Email  
- Endpoint         
- Intrusion Detection
- Infrastructure Support          
- Malware          
- Network session        
- Network Traffic
- Threat Intelligence    
- Updates          
- Vulnerabilities

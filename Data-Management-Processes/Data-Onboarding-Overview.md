This document describes Splunk data onboarding and talks about the lifecycle of Data onboarding along with all the other details that are complementary to our onboarding activity like â€“ purpose, application security, infrastructure security, cloud security, types of logs being onboarded, onboarding methodologies, required fields, Data Onboarding Phases, Timelines for each phase and various processes that are involved in onboarding activities. These data ingestion has a security relevance only after the content use cases that are written over the data. Apart from security data, we are also ingesting referential data Assets and Identities which are useful for GEMS/IR investigation. This is a brief introduction on the Splunk Data onboarding which will guide through all the finer details underneath.

### Purpose

The purpose of Splunk Data Onboarding on a broader level is to ingest all security relevant data in Splunk to create various alerts and contents which in turn is securing the applications, infrastructure and the organization by generating high fidelity alerts and keeping bad actors and attackers at bay. This data is used by Content/GEMS/IR/Threat Intel teams to create alerts/use cases and contents to avoid any malicious activities.
